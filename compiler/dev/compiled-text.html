    <h1 *innerText="$message">This text should be overwritten at compile time</h1>

    <p>
      You should see a "Hello World!" header on this page because the message
      variable is being assigned to the headers innerText property.
    </p>

    <p>
      The compiler should also be able to statically evaluate that the variable
      assigned to innerText is not changed during the runtime of the
      application, and that it can therefore evaluate the innerText at compile
      time. Meaning that this page should have no JavaScript.
