  /*
    By setting the $message variable, you should see that the text below is
    overwritten at compiled time.
    This page should have no runtime overhead.
    Comments below are for debugging block comment support.

    $ message = invalid value
    $ message = "aaaaa";
    $ count = "";
  */
  $ message = "Hello World!";
  /* $ message = "Trailing single line block comment"; */
</script>

<h1 *innerText="$message">This text should be overwritten at compile time</h1>

<p>
  You should see a "Hello World!" header on this page because the message
  variable is being assigned to the headers innerText property.
</p>

<p>
  The compiler should also be able to statically evaluate that the variable
  assigned to innerText is not changed during the runtime of the application,
  and that it can therefore evaluate the innerText at compile time. Meaning that
  this page should have no JavaScript.
