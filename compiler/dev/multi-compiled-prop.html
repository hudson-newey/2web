<script compiled>
$ value = "Hello World!";
</script>

<input *value="$value" />
<input *value="$value" />
<input *placeholder="$value" />
<p>Initial Value: {{ $value }}</p>

<p>
  You should see a bit of javascript on this page to set the initial "value"
  property of the input box to the initial value of the reactive variable.
</p>

<p>
  However, because the reactive variables value is never changed at runtime
  there should be no even listeners, functions, or anything else.
