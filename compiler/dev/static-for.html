<ul>
  {% for 1,2,3 <li>item: {{&value}}</li> %}
</ul>

<p>
  This page should have no runtime overhead because the "for" control flow can
  be evaluated at compile time.
</p>

<p>
  The compiler should be able to infer that the data used in the loop is
  immutable.
  This behavior should be fully transparent to the programmer, so that there is
  a single format for a runtime and compile time "for loop".
