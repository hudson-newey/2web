<title>Reactive Variables</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="dev-styles.css" />

<p>
  In this dev test, a reactive variable has a variable assigned to it. Meaning
  tha we should see the change reflected in the document.
</p>

<p>
  Unlike some other reactivity methods, this reactivity type does not require a
  runtime variable to keep track of state because the state is not dependent on
  the previous state of the same reactive variable.

<script compiled>
  // This is a comment and should not be processed as script. I can therefore
  // add some statements like $ count = 1; without it effecting the output
  // throw new Error("you should not see this");
  $ count = 0;
</script>

<h1 *innerText="$count" data-testid="count-output"></h1>

<div>
  <button @click="$count = $count + 1" data-testid="increment-button">
    Increment
  </button>

  <button @click="$count = $count - 1" data-testid="decrement-button">
    Decrement
  </button>
</div>

<div style="margin-top: 1rem">
  <button @click="$count = ++$count">+1 (alternative)</button>
  <button @click="$count = --$count">-1 (alternative)</button>
</div>
