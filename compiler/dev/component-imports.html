<script compiled>
  import Header from "components/header.component.html";
  import Footer from "components/footer.component.html";
  import Counter from "components/counter.component.html";
</script>

<Header />

<p>
  On this page, we import the footer component through a "esm like" import
  statement.
</p>

<p>The imported name can be used to create a new instance of the component.</p>

<p>
  You will see that I have used the component twice and that the custom
  component is self-closing.
