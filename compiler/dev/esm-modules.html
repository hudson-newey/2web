<title>ESM Modules</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="dev-styles.css" />

<p>
  This page tests importing ESM modules that are written in TypeScript. Because
  we use esbuild under the hood, you should see that these TypeScript files can
  be imported and used as if they were regular ESM imports.

<h1 #greetingOutput></h1>

<script>
  import { sayHello } from "./dev/scripts/esm-test.ts";

  const name = "2Web Programmer";

  // Notice that this variable name conflicts with a variable name inside the
  // "sayHello" function.
  // We expect that EsBuild can successfully correct this name collision.
  const greeting = sayHello(name);

  greetingOutput.innerText = greeting;
</script>
