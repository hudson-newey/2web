<title>Script Tags</title>

<p>
  This page tests having multiple script and style tags on the same page. You
  should see that variables are not shared between the different script blocks
  and that each script tag is separated into their own lazy loaded module.
</p>

<p>
  Note that this actually breaks compatibility with normal HTML behavior, but I
  deeded that this behavior is actually more useful.
</p>

<p>
  This page uses the console output for debugging, so you should check the
  browser console.
</p>

<script>
  const one = 1;
  console.log(one);
</script>

<script>
  const two = 2;
  console.log(two);
</script>

<script>
  const three = 3;
  console.log(three);
</script>

<script>
  // This console log should throw an error because each script tag is scoped
  // meaning that it should not have access to any of the variables outside this
  // code block.
  console.log({ one, two, three, four });
</script>

<script>
  const four = 4;
  console.log(four);
</script>
