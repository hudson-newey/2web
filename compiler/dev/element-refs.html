<title>Reactive Variables</title>

<h1 #outputElement>No Content</h1>

<input #inputElement type="text" />

<script>
  inputElement.addEventListener("input", (event: Event) => {
    outputElement.innerText = event.target.value;
  });
</script>

<p>
  If you type in the input box, you should see that the value is reflected into
  a h1 element.
</p>

<p>
  This reactivity is not done through the 2web reactivity system but uses the
  fact that elements with an "id" attribute creates a variable on the global
  scope to refer to the element.
</p>

<p>
  You'll see that even though we're compiling this page with the 2web compiler,
  there is no overhead, and we have not injected any content or JavaScript that
  you didn't write.
</p>

<p>
  This demonstrates that using 2web is still very useful without the reactivity
  use-cases:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>You can use document partials, so you don't have to write out html boilerplate</li>
  <li>You can use the "element ref" shorthand</li>
  <li>You get to use the 2web ssg module system</li>
  <li>You get an extremely fast compiler</li>
</ol>
