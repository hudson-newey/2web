# Document partials

I previously showed that you don't have to write out the HTML boilerplate tags
such as `DOCTYPE`, `html`, `body`, `meta`, etc...

2Web comes with some sane defaults for the html boilerplate.
By default, we set the `DOCTYPE` to `html`, set the `charset` to `UTF-8`, and
set the `viewport` to `width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0`.

Your first thought at seeing this might be the level of control that you give up
when writing document partials.
However, I have created a solution to this specific problem.

A lot of the time, you want to use `<link>` elements to set favicons, set
stylesheets, preload assets, etc... or you might want to set the page title
using a `<title>` tag.
Additionally most major browsers can perform some optimizations if these
elements are in your page's `<head>` tag.

Therefore, any elements that benefit from this sort of optimization, elements
that belong in the `<head>` tag, or are generated by the boilerplate can be
set / overwritten by simply adding them to your document partial.

For example, creating the following document partial.

```html
<title>My Hello World Program</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />

<h1>Hello World!</h1>
```

Will expand into the following html code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>My Hello World Program</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

As you can see, the `<title>` and `<link>` elements have been injected into the
`<head>` element.
