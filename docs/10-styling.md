# Page/Component styling

We support styling your components through normal css.
If you wish to use a component / styling framework, you can use one if you wish.

Note that we also support styling through
[CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules).

## Route styling

If you want to apply styles to all pages within a directory (not including
sub-directories), you can add a `__styles.css` file to the containing directory.

```txt
└─ .
   ├─ __styles.css
   └─ article.html
```
