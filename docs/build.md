# Build

This repository is set up for a fast development process.

As a result, there is (almost) two build stages.

## GoLang builder

The go-based 2web compiler is built and output in the `build/` directory

## Build web source

A test website is compiled with 2web and output in the `build/` directory.

This is then served through Vite.
