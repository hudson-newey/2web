    <p>
      In this dev test, a reactive variable has a variable assigned to it.
      Meaning tha we should see the change reflected in the document.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unlike some other reactivity methods, this reactivity type does not
      require a runtime variable to keep track of state because the state is not
      dependent on the previous state of the same reactive variable.

    <script compiled>
      $ message = "Hello";
    </script>

    <h1 [innerText $message]></h1>

    <button @click $message = "World"*>World</button>
    <button @click $message = "Me"*>Me</button>
    <button @click $message = "Everyone"*>Everyone!</button>
  </body>
