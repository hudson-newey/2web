        This weird syntax exists because I didn't want to make the lexer
        use regex for tokenization.
        Maybe in the future I'll improve the lexer to use regex and then I can
        probably have a better syntax for this.
        e.g. I like the idea of using an angular like syntax for this.

    <h1 [innerText $message]></h1>

    <p>
        You should see a "Hello World!" header on this page because the message
        variable is being assigned to the headers innerText property.
