    <p>
      In this dev test, a reactive variable has a variable assigned to it. Meaning tha we
      should see the change reflected in the document.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unlike some other reactivity methods, this reactivity type does not require a
      runtime variable to keep track of state because the state is not dependent on the
      previous state of the same reactive variable.
