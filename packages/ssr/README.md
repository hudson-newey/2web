# 2Web Kit - SSR

Basic server side rendering (SSR) functionality for 2web/html web applications.

## Usage

```sh
$ 2web template ssr
>
```

From here, all your applications served through `2web serve` will run through
this ssr server, and `2web build` will produce both a `client/` and `server/`
output.
